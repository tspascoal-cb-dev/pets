# Cloudify Application

GitHub Copilot can help you modernize and adapt your applications for cloud deployment. One of the most powerful features is Agent mode, which allows Copilot to work autonomously across multiple files to implement complex changes. Let's use this capability to enhance our application's database support.

## Scenario

The shelter's application currently uses SQLite, which works great for development and small deployments. However, as the shelter grows and considers cloud deployment options, they want the flexibility to use enterprise database systems like Microsoft SQL Server or PostgreSQL. You'll use GitHub Copilot's Agent mode to add support for these databases while maintaining backward compatibility with SQLite.

## Overview of Copilot Agent mode

Agent mode is an advanced feature of GitHub Copilot that allows it to work more autonomously on your behalf. Unlike regular chat or edits mode, Agent mode can:

- Independently decide which files need to be modified
- Create new files as needed
- Install dependencies and make configuration changes
- Work iteratively to solve complex problems
- Run tests and validate changes

When you activate Agent mode, Copilot becomes your coding partner that can handle end-to-end implementation of features, giving you time to focus on reviewing and validating the changes.

## Using Agent mode to add database support

Let's use Agent mode to modify our backend to support multiple database systems.

> [!NOTE]
> While we suggest using Claude Sonnet 4.5 for this exercise, you're free to experiment with other models if you'd like to see how different models approach the same task.

1. []  Return to Visual Studio Code.
1. []  Close any tabs you may have open in your VS Code to ensure Copilot has a clean context.
1. []  Open or switch to GitHub Copilot Chat.
1. []  Switch to Agent mode by clicking on the chat mode dropdown at the bottom of the Chat view and selecting **Agent**.
    - If asked **Changing the chat mode will end your current session. Would you like to continue?** click **Yes**
    - If you were already in Agent mode, press **+** to start a new session.
1. []  If available, select **Claude Sonnet 4.5** from the list of available models.
1. []  Send the following prompt to the agent (feel free to make changes to the wording if you'd like to experiment):

    ```text
    Add support for Microsoft SQL Server and PostgreSQL in the backend. 
    If there is an env variable called MS_SQL_CONN_STRING or PGSQL_CONN_STRING use that connection string to connect to the server. 
    Otherwise keep using SQLite like currently. Install additional dependencies and or drivers as needed.
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> Because LLMs are probabilistic, not deterministic, the exact changes made can vary. The steps below describe a typical experience, but your experience may differ slightly. Also note that we are a little ambiguous in the prompt on purpose to see how the agent interprets it.


## Monitoring the Agent's progress

As the agent works, you'll see it taking various actions. Watch the terminal window and the VS Code interface to observe:

- The agent analyzing the codebase to understand the current database implementation
- The agent will most likely ask for your permission to execute code, examine his request(s) and authorize it
- Installation of new Python packages (like `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL or `pyodbc` for SQL Server)
- Code changes being made across multiple files
- The agent's reasoning about each step it's taking

> [!TIP]
> The terminal window will show you the commands the agent is running, including any package installations. The editor will highlight changes as they're made, similar to the diff view you saw with Copilot Edits.

## Expected changes

The agent should make modifications to at least two key files:

- **server/app.py** - Updates to the database initialization to support multiple database types
- **server/seed_database.py** - Changes to the seeding logic to work with different database systems

The agent will typically:

1. Add logic to check for environment variables (**MS_SQL_CONN_STRING** or **PGSQL_CONN_STRING**)
2. Configure SQLAlchemy to use the appropriate database connection based on available environment variables
3. Install required database drivers (like **pyodbc**, **psycopg2-binary**)
4. Update the **requirements.txt** file with new dependencies
5. Ensure backward compatibility with SQLite as the default

## Handling (potential) incomplete changes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Sometimes the agent might not modify all necessary files on the first attempt. This can happen if the prompt isn't explicit enough or if the agent prioritizes certain changes over others. This is a normal part of working with AI agents, and you can guide them with follow-up prompts.

**If you notice** that the changes to **server/seed_database.py** were not made because it's not on the **changed files** list at the bottom of Copilot Chat window, you can prompt the agent with a more specific prompt. 

![List of changed files](images/4-cloudify-backend.md)

If the changes were made skip to the next section, otherwise continue. This is the cost we pay for being ambiguous on our prompt.

Use the following prompt:

```text
Make sure to update the server/seed_database.py file to support Microsoft SQL Server and PostgreSQL as well.
```

The agent will then focus on making the necessary updates to that specific file.

## Review and validate the changes

Once the agent completes its work:

1. []  Review the code changes made by the agent across the different files (click on the file names in the **changed files** list at the bottom of the Copilot Chat window to see diffs).
1. []  Check that the **requirements.txt** file has been updated with the new database drivers.
1. []  Ensure the application still works with SQLite by opening it:
    - Navigate to +++http://localhost:5100/api/dogs+++ to verify the API still works
    - Check the frontend at +++http://localhost:4321+++ to ensure the website loads correctly
1. []  Run the Python tests to validate nothing broke (in case the agent wasn't executed the tests already):
    
    ```ps1
    venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
    cd server
    python -m unittest test_app.py
    ```

5. []  If all tests pass and the application works correctly, select **Keep** to keep the changes.

> [!NOTE]
> While we're not actually connecting to SQL Server or PostgreSQL in this exercise, the code is now ready to support them when those environment variables are provided in a cloud deployment.

## Summary and next steps

You've successfully used GitHub Copilot's Agent mode to add enterprise database support to your application! You saw how the agent can autonomously:

- Analyze existing code structure
- Make changes across multiple files
- Install required dependencies
- Work iteratively to complete complex tasks

This makes your application more flexible and ready for cloud deployment.

## What's next?

Now that your application supports enterprise databases, you can explore additional cloud capabilities:

- **Using the MSSQL extension for Visual Studio Code** - Learn how to use Copilot to interact with SQL Server databases directly from VS Code
- **Using GitHub Copilot for Azure** - Discover how to interact with Azure resources using Copilot's Azure integration

Choose the path that interests you most, or explore both to get the full cloud development experience!
